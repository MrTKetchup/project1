				  <p class="card-prose">I grew up in Wells, Somerset and graduated with an MEng in Chemical Engineering from the University of Birmingham in 2013. I now live in Bristol and have done since 2014.</p>
				  <p class="card-prose">
				  	Since graduating I have had a range of different careers varying from Nuclear Safety Consultant to Sous Chef to most recently as a Brewer at a small independent craft brewery located in Bath called Electric Bear Brewing Co.</p>
				  <p class="card-prose">
					  I am now in the next chapter of my life, learning how to develop code and I am currently enrolled at the iO Academy Full Stack Track Bootcamp.

				  <p class="card-prose">I am a keen cyclist and enjoy taking my bike out for a spin to explore the local surroundings (and the pubs in the area).</p>
				  <p class="card-prose">
				  	I enjoy a range of music genres (mostly indie/electronica/funk/soul/punk/rock/cheese) and recently aquired a record player which has given me permission to expand my record collection extensively.

				  <p class="card-prose">
				  	I have a 2 and a half year old Sprocker Spaniel called Cinder. She is a little chaos potato, who hates pigeons and loves leaves.
