						<p class="card-prose">I am now in the next chapter of my life, learning how to develop code and I am currently enrolled at the iO Academy Full Stack Track Bootcamp.

						<p class="card-prose">I am a keen cyclist and enjoy taking my bike out for a spin to explore the local surroundings (and the pubs in the area).</p>
						<p class="card-prose">
					  	I enjoy a range of music genres (mostly indie/electronica/funk/soul/punk/rock/cheese) and recently aquired a record player which has given me permission to expand my record collection extensively.</p>

					  	I have a 2 and a half year old Sprocker Spaniel called Cinder. She is a little chaos potato, who hates pigeons and loves leaves.</p>
